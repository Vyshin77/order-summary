## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge is to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive mobile view
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This challenge helped me to implement media queries and background images in a project. I also learned to useCSS pseudo selectors like the hover

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
```html
 <img src="illustration-hero.svg" alt="person listening to music" class="hero">
```
```css
a:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%, 0.7);
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to implement the media queries in subsequent frontend mentor challenges I'll undertake in future
